A couple of fully configurable quality of life tweaks to improve the game. Did you know rain is pretty nice?

## Fast Printers
Make printers print instantly. Begone 4 second delay!

## Fast Shrine of Chance
Remove the 2 second usage delay from shrine of chances.

## Fast Scrappers
Make scrappers scrap very fast. What normally would take up to 10 seconds with 10 items now takes 1-3 seconds.

*The reason it is not instant is because scrapping 10 items at once is pretty loud and it looks unprofessional.*

## Share Lunar Coins
Everyone will get a lunar coin when one is picked up. Sweet, no more hoarding!

## Teleport Gunner Turrets
Gunner turrets will be teleported to the teleporter when it is activated.
